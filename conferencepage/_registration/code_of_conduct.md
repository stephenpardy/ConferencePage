We value the participation of everyone at Royal Astronomical Society events and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees and staff.

As such RAS meetings will be a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, religion. We do not
tolerate
harassment of attendees in any form.

+ Lecturers give their time freely, many have travelled a considerable distance, some are very distinguished, some are early career scientists perhaps giving a lecture at this level for the first time, and all deserve a fair and encouraging hearing. Please try to be on time for the start of a session, or otherwise slip quietly into the lecture theatre, refrain from loud conversations outside the doors and switch off mobile phones, and if you must use a lap-top computer do so inconspicuously in one of the rear seats.

+ Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

+ All communication given by lecturers, organisers and attendees should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language, jokes and imagery is not appropriate for any event.

+ Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.

+ Respect staff.

+ Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event, without a refund of any charge that may have been levied.

Thank you for helping to make meetings a welcoming, respectful space for all.
