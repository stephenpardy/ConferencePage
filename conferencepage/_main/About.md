<h3>{{ site.title }}<br>October 2-6, 2017 - Valletta, Malta </h3>

<h4> Conference registrations are now closed.</h4>

This conference will bring together world leading experts in galaxy dynamics and cosmology in order to promote collaborative efforts across theoretical, computational, and observational disciplines to try to answer to fundamental questions about the role of gas in galaxy dynamics and evolution. For a full description please see the [motivation]({{ site.baseurl }}/motivation).

#### Support:

##### Thanks to a grant from the RAS we are able to offer accommodation support to early career scientists from the UK. If you are interested in using the RAS support for this meeting, after registering, please contact us at <mailto:grants@gasingalaxiesconference.com> describing why you need support and your position.

##### Thanks to a grant from the publisher [MDPI](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/galaxies) we are able to offer attendance and accommodation support to early career scientists from developing countries. Please see details below.

> Galaxies, an open access journal published by MDPI, is pleased to sponsor a travel grant to support one early stage researcher coming to the Conference "The Role of Gas in Galaxy Dynamics". The award (800 euros) will cover attendance and accommodation costs. Applicants should be based at a research institution in developing country and can apply the grant by sending a CV and cover letter to Ms. Zoey Zhang <mailto:galaxies@mdpi.com>. The deadline to apply for this funding is August 15.
